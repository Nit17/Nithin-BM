# On-Prem LLM Deployment: Hardware, Software, MLOps

## 1. Problem Statement
Deploy and operate large language models within a controlled on-premises (or private cloud) environment meeting strict data sovereignty, latency, and compliance requirements while achieving cost efficiency and reliability.

## 2. Requirements
| Category | Requirement |
|----------|------------|
| Data Sovereignty | No external API calls; all inference & storage local |
| Security | Segmented network zones, encryption at rest/in transit, RBAC |
| Performance | p95 latency targets by model size (<1200ms for 7B, <2s for 13B) |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling & burst handling within cluster |
| Observability | Full metrics, traces, audit logs |
| Upgradability | Rolling model updates with rollback |
| Cost | GPU utilization > 60% sustained |

## 3. Hardware Planning
| Model Size | Precision | VRAM (approx) | Recommended GPU |
|-----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 7B | 4-bit | ~6–8 GB | L4 / A10 |
| 13B | 4-bit | ~10–12 GB | L40S / A100 40GB |
| 70B | 4/8-bit | 40–80 GB (sharded) | 4–8× A100/H100 |

- NVLink beneficial for > 2 GPU tensor parallel.
- Fast NVMe scratch for weight loading & spill.
- Redundant PSU & UPS for power stability.

## 4. Software Stack
| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Container Runtime | Kubernetes (on-prem distro: Rancher / OpenShift) |
| Inference Runtime | vLLM / TensorRT-LLM / Text-Generation-Inference |
| Scheduler | K8s + node labels (gpu-type) + priority classes |
| Storage | Ceph / NFS for model artifacts; local NVMe for hot weights |
| Secrets | Vault / K8s sealed secrets |
| Policy | OPA / Kyverno |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Tempo |
| Logging | Fluent Bit / Vector |

## 5. Model Management
- Artifact registry with versioned model tarballs (weights, tokenizer, config, license).
- Promotion pipeline: staging load test → golden eval → security scan (supply chain) → production tag.
- Hash integrity check on load; verify license compliance before acceptance.

## 6. Inference Optimization
- Quantization (INT8/4-bit) via GPTQ/AWQ; maintain baseline FP16 for regression diff.
- Speculative decoding (small draft model) to reduce first-token latency.
- Dynamic micro-batching (time window 10–25ms); per-batch token length bucketing.
- KV cache pooling & eviction by LRU + memory watermark.

## 7. Multi-Tenancy & Isolation
- Namespaces per business unit; resource quotas.
- GPU node pools (latency tier vs batch tier) with taints & tolerations.
- Admission controller validating model + adapter compatibility.

## 8. Security & Compliance
- TLS everywhere (mTLS service mesh e.g., Istio/Linkerd).
- Image scanning (Trivy/Grype) in CI; signed images (cosign).
- Audit log: {user, model_version, prompt_hash, response_hash, timestamp}.
- PII redaction pre-storage; encryption (AES-256) for logs containing user text.

## 9. Deployment Workflow
1. Commit model manifest (YAML) referencing artifact digest.
2. CI: run unit tests, vulnerability scan, golden eval (quality, safety).
3. CD: canary (5%) with shadow comparison; monitor latency, refusal accuracy.
4. Auto-promote if metrics within SLO for 24h; else rollback.

## 10. Observability
| Metric | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| tokens/sec/GPU | Throughput efficiency |
| p95 latency | SLA adherence |
| cache hit % (KV/prompt) | Optimization effectiveness |
| GPU utilization % | Capacity planning |
| OOM events | Memory tuning required |
| Refusal accuracy | Safety stability |

Traces: request span breakdown (queue wait, batch time, decode time).

## 11. Data Governance
- Retention policies per data class (chat logs vs system prompts vs feedback).
- Right-to-be-forgotten workflow: locate & purge by user pseudonym ID.
- Access review quarterly (least privilege audit).

## 12. Cost Management
- GPU autoscaler (cluster proportional) scales latency tier vs batch tier.
- Idle model eviction after inactivity TTL.
- Consolidate low-usage adapters; archive rarely used weights to cold storage.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Hardware failure | Redundant nodes; replica warm standby |
| Security breach lateral movement | Network policies + microsegmentation |
| Model regression unnoticed | Mandatory golden eval gating |
| GPU fragmentation | Bin-packing & defragmentation rebalancer |
| Supply chain attack | Sigstore signing + provenance attestations |

## 14. Future Enhancements
- Multi-modal model deployment (vision+text) nodes.
- Fine-tune farm (separate GPU pool) with artifact promotion into inference cluster.
- Federated learning for sensitive domain adaptation.

## 15. Interview Summary
"On-prem LLM stack uses Kubernetes with optimized inference runtimes, quantization, and robust observability; model lifecycle is governed by gated promotion, strict security (mTLS, scanning, RBAC), and cost controls (autoscaling, eviction), ensuring compliant, performant AI services."
