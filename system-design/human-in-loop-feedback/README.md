# Human-in-the-Loop Feedback System for LLM Quality Improvement

## 1. Problem Statement
Continuously improve LLM answer quality, safety, and grounding via structured human feedback loops feeding evaluation, prioritization, and fine-tuning / preference optimization pipelines.

## 2. Feedback Taxonomy
| Type | Example | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| Explicit Rating | Thumbs up/down, 1–5 stars | Reward modeling, prioritization |
| Structured Tag | "Incorrect Fact", "Toxic", "Unhelpful" | Error categorization, safety tuning |
| Suggested Edit | User-provided improved answer text | SFT data generation |
| Comparative Pair | A vs B (which better?) | Preference (DPO/RLHF) |
| Passive Signal | Time to follow-up, abandonment | Implicit dissatisfaction proxy |

## 3. Architecture Overview
```
User/App → Feedback Collector API → Validation & PII Scrub → Feedback Store
    → Sampling Orchestrator → Labeling UI (if escalation) → Curated Data Lake
    → Data Processor (dedupe, stratify) → Training Set Builder
    → Fine-Tune / Preference Pipeline (SFT + DPO) → Model Registry → Deployment
    → Evaluation Harness (A/B + Golden Set) → Metrics & Dashboards
```

## 4. Data Model (Feedback Event)
```
feedback_id, user_id_hash, session_id, model_version, prompt_hash,
answer_hash, timestamp, explicit_rating, tags[], edit_text?, pair_group_id?,
latency_ms, context_doc_ids[], safety_flags, region, tenant_id
```
Derived: semantic_embedding(answer), novelty_score, priority_score.

## 5. Prioritization Scoring
`priority = w1*(low_confidence) + w2*(negative_rating) + w3*(high_impact_tenant) + w4*(novel_intent) + w5*(safety_flag)`
- Low confidence from model self-estimate or retrieval coverage metrics.
- Novel intent via embedding distance > threshold from historical cluster centroid.

## 6. Sampling Strategy
- Daily batch: stratify by intent domain, rating polarity, novelty quantile.
- Guarantee inclusion quota for safety-flagged items.
- Cap duplicates per user to avoid bias.

## 7. Labeling Workflow
1. Escalate unclear negative feedback to Labeling UI.
2. Annotators provide corrected answer + issue tags.
3. QA review (second annotator) for high-severity categories.
4. Approved items ingested into curated dataset with provenance.

## 8. Data Processing
- Dedupe (prompt_hash + normalized answer_text Levenshtein distance threshold).
- Safety filter ensures no disallowed content used for positive examples.
- Split into SFT (edited answers) vs Preference pairs (comparative or derived from rating differentials).

## 9. Training Pipelines
- SFT: mix curated corrections with base instruction set (ratio tuned, e.g., 20% new corrections).
- Preference: DPO or RLHF using pair dataset (win/lose) with temperature set to 0 for inference data to reduce noise.
- Adapter-based (LoRA) incremental updates; periodic full consolidation if large drift.

## 10. Evaluation & Guarding
- Golden set with fixed prompts & expected answer attributes (groundedness, tone, structure).
- Safety regression: refusal accuracy, toxicity rate, hallucination rate (RAG groundedness) pre/post deploy.
- A/B shadow testing for 5% traffic before full rollout.

## 11. Observability Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Feedback rate | (# feedback events / # answers) |
| Negative rate | % explicit negative ratings |
| Correction adoption | % edited answers integrated into model |
| Win rate uplift | Preference model vs baseline on pair eval |
| Safety regression | Δ unsafe outputs vs baseline |
| Time-to-incorporate | Feedback → production model (median days) |

## 12. Governance & Compliance
- PII scrubbing & hashing user IDs (salted) pre-storage.
- Provenance fields retained (annotator_id, review_status, dataset_version).
- Audit logs: model_version served, training dataset snapshot hash.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Feedback spam / brigading | Rate limits + clustering anomaly detection |
| Overfitting to narrow domains | Maintain base dataset mixture proportion |
| Safety drift post-fine-tune | Mandatory safety gate eval & rollback plan |
| Latency increase (bigger adapters) | Prune / merge adapters; monitor tokens/sec |
| Privacy breach | PII scrub + encryption at rest / field-level |

## 14. Future Enhancements
- Active learning uncertainty sampling (entropy of candidate completions).
- Automatic critique generation to bootstrap corrections.
- Fine-grained reward model (helpfulness, factuality, safety dimensions separate).

## 15. Interview Summary
"Structured, prioritized feedback events flow through a curation and labeling pipeline producing SFT and preference datasets that incrementally adapt the model (via LoRA) while gated by golden set and safety regressions, with governance ensuring provenance and privacy."
